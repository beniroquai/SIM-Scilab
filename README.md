# SIM-Scilab
An Open Source Code for reconstructing a SIM Image (Structured Illumination Microscopy) to enhance spatial resolution by overlaying an object with a pattern (e.g. sine/cosine) 

You can find a further description of the code in this blog-post:

The patern.sce file generates the desired sine/rect-patterns for the DMD.
The Reconstruction_getPhase_reviewed.sce reconstructs the images

Generated patterns can be found in the folder Patterns.
Acquired images and their reconstructions can be found in the folder Aufnahmen.
